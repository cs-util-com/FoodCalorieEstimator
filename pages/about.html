      <h2>Disclaimers</h2>
      <p>
        CalorieCam provides best-effort estimates powered by Gemini. Results can be off by a wide margin depending on image
        quality, portion size, and model limitations. Always use personal judgement and professional guidance for nutrition or
        medical decisions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Photos and history never leave your browser. Your Gemini API key is stored locally and used directly against Googleâ€™s
        API from this device. Clear the key in Settings if you no longer want to send requests.
      </p>
      <h2>Open source</h2>
      <p>
        The application is built with vanilla JavaScript, Pico.css, and browser APIs. Service workers cache the shell for
        offline access, but estimation requires a network connection.
